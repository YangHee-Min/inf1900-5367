# inf1900-5367

## What is this?
This repository was used for a class where we learned to manipulate embedded systems with code. C++, object oriented programming principles and makefiles were used for this project.

## What does the project do?
We were given virtual pieces of hardware which included the following:
- Atmega324
- Keypad
- Analog-to-digital converter
- LCD screen
- LED bars
- Servomotors
- Sonars

We were then tasked with scheduling various tasks such as turning on/off lights or moving motors when the Analog-to-digital converter displayed a certain time that was set in the user interface.
The user interface was displayed via the LCD screen and inputs were possible via the keypad.

## What are the different folders in your project?

The `ancien tp mis ensemble` and the `tp` sections include the workshops prior to the final project when discovering the new technologies.

The `rapport` folder includes the final documentation of the library that we have created.

The `projet` folder includes the final project that we were tasked with at the end of the fall 2020 semester.

Note: This project is in french since the class was given in french.
